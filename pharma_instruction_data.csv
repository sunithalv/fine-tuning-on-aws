Explain the mechanism of action of Metformin.,,"Metformin activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which increases glucose uptake and fatty-acid oxidation while inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis, thereby lowering blood glucose."
List two non-glycemic benefits of Metformin mentioned in the text.,,Improved cardiovascular outcomes; anti-inflammatory effects. (Also suggested: anticancer potential via mTOR inhibition.)
Why is combining Atorvastatin with Ezetimibe clinically beneficial?,,"Because Ezetimibe blocks intestinal cholesterol absorption (NPC1L1) and Atorvastatin inhibits hepatic HMG-CoA reductase, providing additive LDL-C reduction—useful when statin response is inadequate."
Summarize the key advantages and ongoing research directions for mRNA vaccines.,The success of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 has opened new pathways for rapid vaccine development. mRNA platforms enable flexible design and quick adaptation to emerging viral variants such as BQ.1 and XBB.1.5. Phase-II clinical trials have shown strong immunogenicity with elevated neutralizing antibody titers and robust CD8⁺ T-cell responses. Ongoing research is exploring thermostable formulations and self-amplifying mRNA constructs to enhance global distribution and cost-efficiency.,"mRNA platforms enable rapid, flexible vaccine design and quick variant updates (e.g., BQ.1, XBB.1.5). Phase-II data show strong immunogenicity with robust neutralizing antibodies and CD8⁺ T-cell responses. Current work targets thermostable and self-amplifying formulations to improve distribution and cost."
"From the passage, extract two benefits and two challenges of AI in pharmaceutical R&D.","Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming pharmaceutical research by accelerating target identification, molecular docking, and compound screening. Deep learning models trained on large-scale biological datasets can predict protein–ligand binding affinities and optimize lead compounds. Integrating AI-driven insights with laboratory automation is reducing discovery timelines from years to months. However, challenges remain regarding interpretability, bias mitigation, and regulatory validation for AI-generated molecules.","Benefits: (1) Faster target ID, docking, and screening; (2) Better protein–ligand affinity prediction and lead optimization. Challenges: (1) Limited interpretability and bias risks; (2) Regulatory validation of AI-generated molecules."
